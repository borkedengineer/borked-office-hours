# Unit 1 Assignment - Leaning with justice in mind

### Question 1

You are facilitating a group of 5 students, and 1 student never participates. You ask after class how you can help. The student shares that they are very far behind, and don't know how to keep up because everyone talks so fast. How would you structure the next session to support this student?

### My Response

In a situation like this I'd apply different support systems to help this student regain their confidence and catch up their confidence. I'd apply the following:

1. Assigning a buddy -> I'd assign this student a buddy during group sessions discussions. This peer can also summarize and clarify discussions after class as well.
2. Pre-session material -> I can provide this student with a summary or key points of the next topic for the session. This could help them feel more confident about participating.
3. Feedback loop -> I will encourage this student to tell me what's working or not working. This will allow me to adjust my methods to suit their needs.

### Question 2

You are facilitating a group of three students. Two of the students speak up for the majority of the time. They seem to enjoy engaging with one another, and with the group. One of the students comes to you after class one day, and shares that they want to participate more, but feel like when they try to do so, they get cut off or talked over. How would you support all of your students toward more equal participation in the next session?

### My Resopnse

I need to tackle this for the next session and throughout the course. For the next session I would:

1. Establish ground rules -> Emphasize the respect for everyone's contributions. Everyone has a chance to speak without being interrupted.
2. Structured activities -> Using activities like round robin so everyone contributes.
3. Direct faciliation or roles -> I will gently intervene if someone interrupts or rotate roles of speakers and note takers.

As a TIP coach, I need to do the following to throughout the course:

1. Enmpower quiet students -> Do 1:1's or workshops to build confidence.
2. Provide feedback -> Tell the usual students to include others and encourage the quieter ones.
